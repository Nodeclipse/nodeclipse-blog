## Repositories

Currently there are 2 repositories

[https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse/](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse/) v0.1.8 by LambGao; update 4 months ago;  
 web-site [http://www.nodeclipse.org/](http://www.nodeclipse.org/)
 
[https://github.com/tomotaro1065/nodeclipse/](https://github.com/tomotaro1065/nodeclipse/) v0.2
 (and expected 0.3) by Tomoyuki Inagaki; in development;  
 web-site [http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/](http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/)

This may be source of confusion, but we expect to clone tomotaro1065 repository into [Nodeclipse organization](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/),
and discuss how to merge and continue after 0.3 release. 
<!-- The cause was moving original repository into new GitHub Nodeclipse organization. -->

Currently we focus on collecting ideas, and getting users feedback. 
 For that we promote our project in developers communities and to our friends.
 
We are to come to regular releases in the future. But for now shaping of project (what to include) is undetermined.

## Distribution

Update sites:

Download site v0.1.8: <code>http://www.nodeclipse.org/updates</code>  
Download site v>0.2 (Nodeclipse-1): <code>http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/updates/</code>  

[https://github.com/PaulVI/eclipse-node-ide](https://github.com/PaulVI/eclipse-node-ide) repository (aka Enide) is for distributing Nodeclipse together with other plugins.

We are expecting to have Nodeclipse on [Eclipse Marketspace](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/)

<!--
Maybe later have own Eclipse distribution.
-->
