## Repositories

Currently there are 2 repositories

[https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse/](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse/) v0.1.8 by LambGao; update 4 months ago
 [web-site http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/](http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/)
 
[https://github.com/tomotaro1065/nodeclipse/](https://github.com/tomotaro1065/nodeclipse/) v0.2 (and expected 0.3) by Tomoyuki Inagaki; in development,
 [web-site http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/](http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/)

This may be source of confusion, but we expect to clone tomotaro1065 repository into [Nodeclipse organization](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/),
and discuss how to merge and continue after 0.3 release.

Currently we focus on collecting ideas, and getting users feedback. 
 For that we promote our project in developers communities and to our friends.
 
We are to come to regular releases in the future.
