## Repositories

[Nodeclipse organization](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/) has several [repositories](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/repositories).
 Use star to vote what you think is most important.

Main effort is Nodeclipse Eclipse plugin. Currently is has 2 repositories:

[https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse/](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse/) v0.1.8 by LambGao; update 4 months ago;  
 web-site [http://www.nodeclipse.org/](http://www.nodeclipse.org/)
 
[https://github.com/tomotaro1065/nodeclipse/](https://github.com/tomotaro1065/nodeclipse/) v0.2
 (and expected 0.3) by Tomoyuki Inagaki; in development;  
 web-site [http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/](http://www.tomotaro1065.com/nodeclipse/)

This may be source of confusion, but we expect to clone tomotaro1065 repository into [Nodeclipse organization](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/),
and discuss how to merge and continue after 0.3 release. 
<!-- The cause was moving original repository into new GitHub Nodeclipse organization. -->

Currently we focus on collecting ideas, and getting users feedback. 
 For that we promote our project in developers communities and to our friends.
 
We are to come to regular releases in the future. But for now it is about shaping of project.
