File -> New -> Node Project

This will add Eclipse .project file, and shows your files in Project Explorer.

## chromedevtools

### What will happen if user already had standard chromedevtools and installs Nodeclipse 0.2 ?
 
The current version of standard chromedevtools is 0.3.8.
The version of chromedevtools, which Nodeclipse 0.2 bundles, is 0.3.9.
 
So, chromedevtools  will be over-written to  0.3.9.
 
### What will happen if user installs standard chromedevtools after Nodeclipse 0.2 ?

Chromedevtools will not be over-written to 0.3.8. It will  remain 0.3.9.
 
But we must always keep in mind the current version of standard chromedevtools.


### So what will happen if chromedevtools 0.3.9 or chromedevtools 0.4.0 are released?

We must update the version of our chromedevtools to 0.4.1 ASAP.
Otherwise, Nodeclipse will not work correctly. But It will be affected only debugging features.
